# Outline of this repository:
This repo contains code and materials to run an experimental procedure that closely follows B & P 2011. The experiment is written in Presentation's SDL language, using a pair of python scripts to generate pseudo-random stimuli lists for a set of subjects. For an example of how to use these scripts, see example.py . A compatible anaconda environment is also included. Experimental materials are located in redboat/Stim. 

# Experiment Summary: See original paper for complete methods 
Subjects performed two tasks, in alternating blocks: 

In "Phrase" or "Composition" blocks, subjects read either a phrase made of a color adjective and noun (e.g. red boat) or a non-word and word combination (xyk boat). They then saw an image, and used a button press to indicate whether the image matches the single word or phrase.

In "List" or "non-composition" blocks, subjects read either a list of two nouns (key, boat) or a non-word and word combination (xyk boat). They then saw an image, and used a button press to indicate whether the image matched either one of the two words (on 2 word trials) or the single word (on 1 word trials).

# Experimental materials

The language stimuli can be summarized as follows:

25 critical head nouns (bad, bell, boat, bone, bow, cane, car, cross, cup, disc, flag, fork, hand, heart, house, key, lamp, leaf, lock, note, plane, shoe, square, star, tree).

6 color adjectives (red, blue, pink, black, green, brown)

6 length-matched unpronounceable consonant strings (xkq, qxsw, mtpv, rjdnv, wvcnz, zbxlv)

6 length-matched nouns, appearing in the 1st position of lists (cup, boat, lamp, plane, cross, house)

Each task contained 100 trials in each of the 2-word and 1 word conditions, with 4 repetitions of each critical head noun. Each task contained an equal number of match/mismatch trials. In 2 word composition conditions, half of the mismatches were due to a mismatching modifier, and the other half due to a mismatching head. In 2 word list conditions, half of the matches were to the 1st item, and hte other half to the 2nd item. The 200 trials in each task were divided into 4 blocks of 50, with an equal number of 1-word and 2-word trials in eahch block. Block order (list or phrase 1st) was balanced across subjects. As was the button (left/right) that corresponded to the match/mismatch response. 

The current version of the experiment is run in Presentation (Neurobehavioral systems), using only the SDL language. The python scripts StimListGen.py and WritingScenarios.py generate random stimuli lists for each subject and write them to Presentation Scenario files, respectively. Constraints on stimulus generation include:

i. No list condition trial was allowed to be a noun repeated (e.g. cross, cross).

ii. No 1st word item could appear with a single noun more than twice.

# Deviations from Bemis & Pylkkanen 2011:

1. For each subject, B & P selected set of 50 images that were repeated in each 1-word/2-word condition. Here, 200 unique images are pseudo-randomly selected for each subject, with the desired number of match/mismatch trials.

2. B & P used a random ISI between trials sampled from a normal distribution with mean of 400 ms. Here, a discrete uniform distribution across 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 ms was used.

3. The present version includes a balance of left/right responses across subjects.
